# Adult-Census-Income

#### Purpose:

  This project is to predict a person's salary lies in either 50K+ or 50K-. 

#### 1.1 Data Extraction

   * The Adult-Census-Income is from kaggle:
   
   
        https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/adult-census-income
   
    
   * Dataset Features:

        Salary, age, workclass, fnlwgt, education, education_num, marital-status, occupation, relationship, race, sex, capital-gain,capital-Loss, hours-per-week, native-country
  
   * The `Salary` Feature is the label we want to predict.
  
#### 1.2 Data Preprocess

  
  * Transforming Feature
  
      ```
      Some Features contains string values and convert them into numerical values.
      ```
      Method: Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding
  
  * Imputing Missing Values
  
      ```
      Some Features contain the missing values like NAN, ? or space.
      ```
      Method: Feature Mode, Median and Mean
  
  * Dealing with Imbalanced Data
       
       ```
       Salary Feature is unbalanced labeled. 
       The salary > 50k is around 80% and <= 50K is 20%.
       ```
      Method: Bagging and Undersampling
      
#### 1.3 Model Selection
  
  
  * Random Sampling of Training Data
      
      From training dataset, use Undersampling method by selecting a subset of the majority examples to match the number of minority examples to create a balanced dataset.
        
  
  * Building Classifier
  
      Classification Algorithms Selected:
  
      `K-nearest-neighborhood`, `Support Vector Machine`, `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `Navie Bayes`, `Decision Tree`, `Adaboost Decision Tree`
     
   * Ensemble Learning
    
        Each instance of training and test data is classified 0 (corresponding to less or equal than 50K dollars annually) or 1 (corresponding to greater than 50K annually) using the learned classifiers.
        
        Final prediction is made by taking a majority vote model among the predictions of these classifiers
